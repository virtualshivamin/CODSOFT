Guess the Number Program  (What and why i have used.)

1. Header Files
#include <iostream> - Enables input/output (cin, cout) operations.
#include <cstdlib> - Includes functions like rand(), srand() for random numbers.
#include <ctime> - Includes time() for generating different random seeds.

2. Main Function - Entry point of the program. "int" return type indicates the program ends by returning an integer.

3. Seeding the Random Number Generator
time(nullptr) - Returns current time in seconds.
static_cast<unsigned int> - Converts time to correct type for srand.
srand(...) - Seeds the random number generator so rand() gives different results each run.

4. Generate Random Number
rand() - Generates a random integer.
% 100 - Restricts it to range 0–99.
+ 1 - Shifts range to 1–100.
secretNumber - Stores the random number to be guessed.
